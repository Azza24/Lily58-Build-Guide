   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the Lily58 BuildGuide!
=================================
This build guide will take you trough the process of building your own lily58 keyboard from start to finish. 
Most steps don't need to be done in the order described but I found this was the easiest way. 
You do obviously need to have the software and your key map before you flash your microcontroller.

**Important notice: The two sides communicate through I2C. 
Unplugging the TRRS cable while powered on could cause damage to your micro controller. 
Always unplug USB first.**
