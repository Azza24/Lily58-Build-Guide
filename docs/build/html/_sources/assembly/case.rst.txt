Assembling your case
====================
Assembling your case is very straight forward. Screw the large standoff onto the oled cover. Then attatch the oled cover to the pcb. 
Put screws and standoffs trough all the holes in the bottom plate, put the standoffs trough the pcb and screw the plate in.
